### Just keep hacking :hammer:

I'm Chris! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a focus on telemetry and controls for hardware systems. I bring a unique interdisciplinary skillset that combines software, UI/UX, mechanical & electrical prototyping, and fabrication. In my spare time, I build and fly RC airplanes, drones, and cars.

Currently, I'm working at 908 Devices as a software engineer in R&D, building software for 908 Devices' line of portable, chemical analysis devices based on high-pressure mass spectrometry.

Outside of work, I have a background in autonomous and electric vehicle development. I spent four years as a member of the University of Rochester's solar boat team, where I led a data-driven approach that used a modular telemetry system to optimize our electric drivetrain system. In my spare time, I build and fly RC airplanes, drones, and cars.
