### Just keep hacking :hammer:

I'm Chris! I'm a full-stack software engineer with a focus on telemetry and controls for hardware systems. I bring a unique interdisciplinary skillset that combines software, mechanical & electrical prototyping, and fabrication. In my spare time, I build and fly RC airplanes, drones, and cars.

I'm always working on something -- Check out some of my pinned repositories for some of the projects I'm most proud of.
